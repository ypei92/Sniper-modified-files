  I really enjoy this class. Though I had some doubt about the way of learning at the beginning of this semester, Reading paper with open discussion turns out to be a great method. The heated atmosphere in the class keep me being involved in and thinking. I learned a lot during this class. On the other hand, I really wanna express my gratitude to Dr. Lin and Dr. Jain. Thank you for preparing clasee\&paper for us and answer our questions timely and patiently.
