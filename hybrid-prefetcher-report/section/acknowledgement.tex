  I really enjoy this class. Though I had some doubt about the way of learning at the beginning of this semester, Reading paper with open discussion turns out to be a great method. The heated atmosphere in the class keep me being involved in and thinking. I learned a lot during this class. On the other hand, I really wanna express my gratitude to Dr. Lin and Dr. Jain. Thank you for preparing classes\&paper for us and answer our questions timely and patiently.

 This is the first course I took with so much interaction between instructors and students. I really like the way that we learn through questioning and discussing. In this course, it's like we went through the whole 30-year history of cache replacement policy and prefetching, and finally a gorgeous picture presented in front of us. I also learned a lot on learning skills, how to grasp the idea, how to criticize, how to improve current work etc. In the future, maybe I will forget some material in the class, but these learning skills will be the most useful and I will always keep in mind. Thank you so much for your preparation on the course and patience for us.
